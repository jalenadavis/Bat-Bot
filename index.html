<p>Bat-Bat is an engineering marvel that is a drone that mimics the flight of a bat. It has a carbon-fiber skeleton and a silicone membrane. It weighs only 3.3 ounces, has five micro-sized motors, and sensors. It is capable of flying autonomously. It's flight is almost indistinguishable from a bat's

<p>The coolest thing about Bat-Bot is how difficult it is to mimic a bat's movements. Arguably bats have the most sophisticated powered flying mechanisms among animals. This is because bats use ver 40 joints and the flexible membrane (patagium) when flying. Bat Bot has only nine joints making it a sophisticated robot but a simple bat.
