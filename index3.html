<p>Bat-Bot was designed by a trio roboticists led by Soon-Jo Chung a professor of aerospace at the California Institute of Technology.</p>

The plan was for them to do a better and safer job getting into disaster sites and scoping out construction zones than bulky drones with spinning rotors, for example, it would have been ideal for going inside the damaged Fukushima nuclear plant in Japan. The researchers still need to add cameras, build more drones and get permission from federal agencies to fly them.

The inspiration was a fascinations for bats and the complexities in their flight. "Whenever I see bats make sharp turns and perform upside down, perching with such elegant wing movements and deformations, I get mesmerized," said Soon-Jo Chung. The main goal was to create a safer, more efficient drone. Chung imagines that future incarnations of Bat Bot could fly about new building sites mid-construction, perching on beams to snap photos, or to spy mistakes or other structural flaws. If one bumps into a construction worker, no problem.
