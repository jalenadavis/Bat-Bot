<p>The Bat Bot has nine joints and measures slightly less than 8 inches from head to tail. Its super-thin membrane wings span about a foot and a half. It can flap its wings as fast as ten times per second. It only weighs 3.3 ounces, it has five micro-sized motors, and sensors</p>

<p>University of Pennsylvania engineering professor Vijay Kumar said in an email, "it is too early to tell if these designs will actually be superior." Smaller fixed-wing drones have problems with maneuverability and four rotors are not efficient, so a bat-inspired design is "a very intriguing line of research." It's already taken three years and cost $1.5 million, including a team of experts from Brown University who studied bat flight.</p>
